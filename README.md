// Adding Two Numbers Endpoint
// This program takes the users input from the url bar
// and checks to see if the user inputed numbers
// If so then it will add those two numbers
// Peer Reviewed by: John Magpantay
// notes: Program looks good, Code is executing well. Data validation
// is probably the highlight, Even in API's data validation is still very crucial. Good work overall!
